Installs [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net) and a related cron job.
This allows servers to be quickly queried en mass for any matched
signatures.  The
[ClamAV-Report](https://github.com/cisagov/clamav-report) tool can be
used to gather scan data from systems using this role.

### Example ###

```yaml
clamav_freshclam_configuration:
  DatabaseMirror: ['db.local.clamav.net', 'database.clamav.net']
  Bytecode: 'true'
  PrivateMirror:
```

would change:

```properties
  ...
  DatabaseMirror foo.bar.com
  DatabaseMirror bar.baz.com
  PrivateMirror private.mirror.local
  Bytecode false
  ...
```

to:

```properties
  ...
  DatabaseMirror db.local.clamav.net
  DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
  Bytecode true
  ...
```

## Dependencies ##

None.

## Example Playbook ##

Here's how to use it in a playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  tasks:
    - name: Install ClamAV and a cron job to run automated AV scans
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: clamav
```

## Cron job output ##

The log of the last scan is accessible at: `/var/log/clamav/lastscan.log`

If a detection occurs the file `/var/log/clamav/last_detection` will be touched.
Its modification time represents the time of the last detection.
