# If a systemd host lacks the file /sbin/init, then testinfra
# currently misidentifies it as using SysV.  The relevant code can be
# viewed here:
# https://github.com/philpep/testinfra/blob/master/testinfra/modules/service.py#L51-L63.
#
# The Debian 9 and Debian 10 Docker images that we are using suffer
# from this issue; therefore, we need to install the init package as a
# workaround.  Any real (non-Docker) host will have this package
# installed anyway.
#
# This is a known testinfra issue.  See
# https://github.com/philpep/testinfra/issues/416 for more details.
